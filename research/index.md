# Jensen's Inequality, Partition Functions, and Models with Ternary Interactions

- Undergraduate thesis supervised by Prof. Dominik Scheder
- Developed lower and upper bounds for the PPZ algorithm on regular critical clause structure
- Reveals behaviour of the PPZ algorithm on large-girth formulas

# Computing Power of the Game Manufactoria

- Formalises the computation model in the game *Manufactoria*
- Proves Turing completeness and discusses other aspects of its computing power
- [The game](http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/) &#124; [PDF manuscript](./Manufactoria.pdf)

# *SimPL* Interpreter

- Enables imperative and functional programming
- Built-in type inference mechanism and Hindley-Milner polymorphism
- Supports garbage collection, stream operation, and tail recursion optimisation
- [GitHub](https://github.com/YanhengWang/SimPL)
