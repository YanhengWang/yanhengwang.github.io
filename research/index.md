# Exact Perfect Matching

- my master thesis supervised by Prof. Bernd GÃ¤rtner and Nicolas El Maalouly
- collection of (old and) new results about the Exact Perfect Matching problem from three frontiers: combinatorial, algebraic, and integer programming
- [PDF](./master-thesis.pdf)

# A Perfect Sampler for Hypergraph Independent Sets

- with Guoliang Qiu and Chihao Zhang &#124; ICALP 2022
- a "coupling from the past" sampler based on systematic scan chain, working almost up to hardness bound
- [PDF](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/16444/) &#124; [slides](./hyper-ind-set.pdf)

# Jensen's Inequality, Partition Functions, and Models with Ternary Interactions

- my bachelor thesis supervised by Prof. Dominik Scheder
- builds lower and upper bounds for the PPZ algorithm on regular critical clause structure, and reveals its behaviour on large-girth formulas
- [PDF](./bachelor-thesis.pdf) &#124; [slides](./bachelor-slides.pdf)

# *SimPL*

- design and implementation of a simple imperative+functional programming language
- supports type inference, polymorphism, garbage collection, stream operation, and tail recursion optimisation
- [GitHub](https://github.com/YanhengWang/SimPL)

# Computing Power of the Game Manufactoria

- discusses the model and power of the game *Manufactoria*
- [PDF](./Manufactoria.pdf) &#124; [the game](http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/)
