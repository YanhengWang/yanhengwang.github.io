# A Perfect Sampler for Hypergraph Independent Sets

- With Guoliang Qiu and Chihao Zhang
- Based on the systematic scan Markov chain and the "coupling from the past" paradigm
- Works almost up to hardness bound when the hypergraph is uniform and regular
- [PDF](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/16444/) &#124; [slides](./hyper-ind-set.pdf)

# Jensen's Inequality, Partition Functions, and Models with Ternary Interactions

- My undergraduate thesis, supervised by Prof. Dominik Scheder
- Builds lower and upper bounds for the PPZ algorithm on regular critical clause structure
- Reveals behaviour of the PPZ algorithm on large-girth formulas

# *SimPL*

- A simple imperative and functional programming language and its implementation
- Built-in type inference mechanism and Hindley-Milner polymorphism
- Supports garbage collection, stream operation, and tail recursion optimisation
- [GitHub](https://github.com/YanhengWang/SimPL)

# Computing Power of the Game Manufactoria

- Formalises the computation model in the game *Manufactoria*
- Proves Turing completeness and discusses other aspects of its computing power
- [Manuscript](./Manufactoria.pdf) &#124; [The game](http://pleasingfungus.com/Manufactoria/)
