# Approximating Klee's Measure Problem and a Lower Bound for Union Volume Estimation

- with Karl Bringmann, Kasper Green Larsen, André Nusser, and Eva Rotenberg &#124; SoCG 2025
- for union volume estimation, shows that the query complexity of the Karp-Luby-Madras algorithm is optimal
- for the special case of Klee's measure problem, gives a faster algorithm in constant dimension

# Exact Perfect Matching

- my master thesis supervised by Prof. Bernd Gärtner and Nicolas El Maalouly
- collection of old and new results about the exact perfect matching problem from three frontiers: combinatorial, algebraic, and integer programming
- [PDF](./master-thesis.pdf)

# A Perfect Sampler for Hypergraph Independent Sets

- with Guoliang Qiu and Chihao Zhang &#124; ICALP 2022
- a "coupling from the past" sampler based on systematic scan chain, working almost up to hardness bound
- [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02050) &#124; [slides](./hyper-ind-set.pdf)

# Jensen's Inequality, Partition Functions, and Models with Ternary Interactions

- my bachelor thesis supervised by Prof. Dominik Scheder
- builds lower and upper bounds for the PPZ algorithm on regular critical clause structure, and reveals its behaviour on large-girth formulas
- [PDF](./bachelor-thesis.pdf) &#124; [slides](./bachelor-slides.pdf)

# *SimPL*

- design and implementation of a simple imperative+functional programming language
- supports type inference, polymorphism, garbage collection, stream operation, and tail recursion optimisation
