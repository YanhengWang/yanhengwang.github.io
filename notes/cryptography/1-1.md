For thousands of years, signatures and more broadly stamps and seals had been used in literally every society to bind a person with an entity. Even in the Stone Age, before the emergence of written languages, human carved symbolic shapes to signify their unique cultural identity. Signatures, nowadays in more refined forms, are still widely deployed in modern societies. Though in some cases, they could also fail to fulfil their intended goal.

Then one may ask: what is the machinery in their effectiveness and sometimes ineffectiveness? How would one design and implement a more effective signature? These lead us to a quest for the *nature* of signatures.

Back to the primitive tribes in prehistoric times, signatures on an appliance conceivably served to display possession of superior power or culture. The tradition continues all the way to modern days, for example when an artist signs her painting to proudly claim the ownership of the aesthetic value she created, or when a food company brands trademark on its product to associate the taste with the enterprise itself. Conversely, a craftsman would be unmotivated to sign a clumsy experimental work due to lack of merit. We could thus put it this way:

> Via signature, a signer actively ties himself to the inherent quality of an entity.

Hence signatures are meant to be exclusive from a signer's perpective. He intends to establish via signature a permanent, immutable bond to certain quality. And the foremost demand is *unforgeability*, namely no one else could change his signature on the signed entity (thus jeopardising the bond), or copy his signature onto a new entity (thus announcing fake bond and potentially harming his fame).

Now we could observe some accidental and dramatic effects of signatures from the persepective of other parties. Signatures (which are assumed unforgeable) allow a third party to quickly connect a person with a quality -- may it be good or bad. In other words, a signature witnesses an *undeniable* announcement made by the signer.

This way of thinking in turn feeds back and reshapes how signatures could be used. A person could now *request* others to sign a given entity in order to create a desired undeniable bond. He may later show this piece on court to end disputes. In this setting, the person who signs does not actively sign for merit, but rather passively for reassurance to the requester.

> Via signature, a signer passively ties himself to the quality set by a requester.

Such twofold usage made (unforgeable) signatures desirable for all parties. But the crux is about how to enforce unforgeability. To put it differently: By what machinery could one distinguish a real signature and a forgery?

If the signer and forger were two clones of the same person, one could by no means distinguish their signatures. Luckily this shall not happen in reality. Two persons always have different abilities, habits, characters, and so on. Then the signer must incorporate his distinctive hidden feature, or asymmetry, into his signature to make it unforgeable. Signing is a process that the signer reveals his secret, so to speak.

- Classical signature reveals one's handwriting style, e.g. the patterns of his hand motion, ink selection, pressing on nib.
- Seal in ancient China reveals the characteristic of the seal itself, e.g. its material, flatness of surface, cracks, and the carving of the characters.
- Fingerprints reveals one's biometrical information.

These approaches do significantly increase the cost of forgery, but perfect unforgeability is merely a dream. After sufficient amount of exposures, the "secrets" could largely be learnt and imitated by experts, hence compromising the signatures. Apparently we are fighting against two paradoxical goals: On the one hand a signer must reveal secrets to distinguish himself from a potential forger; on the other hand a revealed secret is no longer a secret, so he and the forger are symmetric again. The only advantage of the signer is that he is *leading in time*. If it takes more than a lifetime for the forger to duplicate the signature, then the signer wins.

Same principle holds for cryptographically-based digital signature. Forgery is always possible, but if it takes unreasonably many resources to complete, then the signature is pratically unforgeable.
