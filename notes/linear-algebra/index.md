This series aims at exploring the intuitions and cores of linear systems. In particular, I hope to interleave my accounts on linear algebra with linear programming -- a rich field of great theoretical significance that relies heavily on linear algebra. The reference materials that I'm using are

- MIT course 18.06 by Professor Gilbert Strang;
- *Understanding and Using Linear Programming*, by Matousek and Gartner.

The outline is sketched below (and might be subject to changes):

1. Equations and matrices: Viewing multiplication as vector processing; Gauss-Jordan elimination and its consequence on matrix decomposition.
1. Linear space: Exploiting the structure of solution to AX=b; rank, dimension and basis.
	- with an appendix on general theory of linear space
	- application in graph theory
1. Linear programming fundamentals: Standard form of LP; basic feasible solutions, stressing connections with previous chapter.
1. Orthogonality: Why is projection useful?
1. Simplex method for LP: Geometry intuition and proof of correctness.
1. Duality theorem for LP: Intuition; a proof from Simplex method, and a proof from Farkas lemma.
1. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
1. Determinant, permanent and their applications: Integral programming made simple, in particular Konig's Theorem; finding and counting matchings.
