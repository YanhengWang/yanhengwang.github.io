Convex polytopes, or simply *polytopes*, are analogues of (convex) polygons in higher dimensions. There are two obvious ways to generalise a polygon, depending on which observation you made:

- Polygons are convex hulls of 2D points. So we could define polytopes to be convex hulls of points in $\Real^d$.

- Polygons are intersections of finitely many halfplanes. So we could define polytopes to be intersections of finitely many halfspaces in $\Real^d$.

Both definitions are reasonable; amazingly they are also equivalent. We will prove this fundamental result in the next chapter.

Human intuition encounters a huge barrier in visualising even a 4-dimensional polytope, despite the clear picture we all had in $\Real^2$ and $\Real^3$. So what's the point of studying something we could not see? Simply because polytopes arise naturally when people consider a linear system of inequalities

$$ A \vec{x} \leq \vec{b}. $$

Systems of this kind could model various theoretical and practical problems. The central question is, of course, understanding the structure of its solution space. But it turns out that the space is what we call a polytope: Each row of the system encodes a halfspace!

The study of polytopes is a dance between geometry and algebra. We draw geometric ideas and mechanisms from 2D and 3D, but implement them via pure algebraic arguments. For a good start, we develop some linear algebra preliminaries that we shall constantly use.

# Linear Algebra Preliminaries

## Linear spaces

Recall that $V \subseteq \Real^d$ is a *linear space* if it is closed under linear combinations. That is, for all $\lambda, \mu \in \Real$ and $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in V$ we have $\lambda \vec{x} + \mu \vec{y} \in V$. The condition enforces the space to "extend flat" through the origin.

Some equivalent charactersations are in order:

- $V = \span(A)$ for some vectors $A = (\vec{x}_1, \dots, \vec{x}_n) \in \Real^{d \times n}$.
- $V$ is the solution space for some linear equation $A \vec{x} = \vec{0}$ where $A \in \Real^{d \times n}$.

## Affine spaces

For our study, the notion of linear space is not general enough. We want to drop the restriction of "passing through origin" while keeping our space "flat".

**Definition.** An *affine space* is a shifted linear space. Formally, $U$ is an affine space if $U = V + \vec{b} := \set{ \vec{x}+\vec{b} : \vec{x} \in V}$
for some linear space $V$ and vector $\vec{b}$.

Given an affine space $U$, we may "undo" the shift and recover the (unique) underlying linear space by taking $U - \vec{b}$ for *arbitrary* vector $\vec{b} \in U$. The argument is one-liner algebra, which we leave as an exercise.

In the sight of this one-one correspondence, we define the *dimension* of an affine space as the dimension of its underlying linear space. We call $(d-1)$-dimensional affine spaces in $\Real^d$ *hyperplanes*.

Still, constructing an affine space from definition is a bit implicit and unwieldy. In the familiar realm of linear spaces, we usually begins our construction with "spanning" a specific set of vectors. For example, $\span \set{ (0,0,1)^\T, (1,1,1)^\T }$ grows an entire linear space by two initial "directions" or "bases". We also want an analogue for

$$ \aff\set{\vec{x}_1, \dots, \vec{x}_n} := \vec{x}_i + \span\set{ \vec{x}_j - \vec{x}_i : j \in [n] }. $$




Then we could transfer the fruitful theory (e.g. rank, independence) on linear spaces to affine spaces.
