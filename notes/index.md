# Geometry: Combinatorics & Algorithms

> A broad sample of discrete geometry, with an eye to both combinatorial properties and computational aspects. The notes are divided into three parts: planar embeddings, points and lines in 2D, and convex polytopes. [➤](./geometry)

# Algebraic Tools in Combinatorics

> See algebra *in action* via bags of applications. Three genres of tools are collected: dimensional argument, roots of equation systems, and graph spectrum. [➤](./algebraic-tools)

# Linear Algebra & Linear Programming

> Pending... Intends to convey the intuitions in linear algebra and the methodology of transferring them to formal arguments. The theory of linear programming contributes a working example. [➤](./linear-algebra)

# Theory of Computation

> Classical materials in formal languages, automata, computability and basic complexity theory. [➤](./computation)

# Programming Languages

> Theoretical studies of the design and construction of a programming language, with emphasis on typing systems. [➤](./program-language)

# Counting and Sampling

> A mixture of notes that collect cool ideas of attacking counting/sampling problems. The main theme is about Markov chain Monte Carlo, but some analytic tools are also included. [➤](./sampling)
