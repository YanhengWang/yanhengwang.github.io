$$\ECM^1$$ secure schemes seem pretty useless but turn out extremely powerful. In this chapter we shall achieve $$\ECM$$ security by building on top of any $$\ECM^1$$ secure scheme. Along the way we will explore the important and indispensable concept of *hash functions* which has broad use in cryptography.

# Appetizer: A $$\ECM^\ell$$ Secure Scheme

Let us warm up with the so-named $$\ECM^\ell$$ attack protocol, a crude approximation to the true $$\ECM$$ protocol. Here in the $$\ECM^\ell$$ protocol, the adversary is allowed to submit up to $$\ell = \ell(k)$$ chosen messages in the beginning where $$\ell(k)$$ is a polynomial *fixed in advance by the signer*. For comparison: the true $$\ECM$$ protocol does not enforce a predetermined polynomial upper bound and thus can handle all possible polynomial adversaries.

**Exercise.**
Write a formal definition of the $$\ECM^\ell$$ attack protocol.

Although $$\ECM^\ell$$ security is weaker than $$\ECM$$ security, it is already applicable in some practical contexts. More importantly, it is rather easy to achieve and gives us valuable insights.

Take any $$\ECM^1$$ secure scheme $$\Sigma = (\gen,\sgn,\vrf)$$ as blackbox. We construct a $$\ECM^\ell$$ secure scheme $$\Sigma' := (\gen',\sgn',\vrf')$$ which basically runs $$\ell$$ independent copies of $$\Sigma$$:

**Exercise.**
Prove its soundness and $$\ECM^\ell$$ security.

In practical applications, we need to distribute/broadcast $$pk$$ safely to the public domain. This is a costly job in every aspects, so a much shorter key length, ideally independent of $$\ell$$, is desirable. Observe that the $$i$$-th signing/verifying depends only on $$(sk_i, pk_i)$$, so it appears unnecessary to publish the entire public key bundle from the outset. Can we publish the $$pk_i$$ on the fly, say attaching it only when the $$i$$-th signature is requested? Here is a plausible attempt:

The scheme is sound but not at all secure! Philosophically, we did not give away any public information, so of course the verifier cannot distinguish authetic and fake signatures. Concretely, a forger could generate himself any key pair $$(sk^*,pk^*)$$ and forge $$(m, pk^* \Vert \sgn(sk^*,m))$$. By doing so, he fools the verifier to use a wrong public key.

To fix this critical bug, we must "certify" the authenticity of the public key shipped with the signature. To this end, we generate an initial key pair $$(sk_1, pk_1)$$ as our "root key" and publish $$pk_1$$. 

Perhaps the easiest way is to use *hash functions* to generate a "checksum". Roughly speaking, a hash function
