Utilising any one-time secure scheme as blackbox, we can build multi-time secure schemes with little effort. Here "multi-time" stands for $$\CM_q^-$$ where $$q \in \Nat$$ is a predetermined constant. That is, the adversary can submit $$q$$ queries from the outset.

**Exercise.**
Give a formal definition of $$\ECM_q^-$$ attack protocol. How does it differ from the $$\ECM^-$$ attack protocol?

Let $$\Sigma = (\gen,\sgn,\vrf)$$ be any $$\ECM_1^-$$ secure scheme. We will begin with contructing a transparent $$\ECM_q^-$$ which basically runs $$q$$ independent copies of $$\Sigma$$. Sadly its public key is too long for practical deployment. We shall then progressively improve the key length using the notions of hash functions and Merkle trees.
