As a preliminary step towards our ultimate goal, we define a significantly weakened attack protocol.

**Definition.**
The *$$\ECM_1^-$$ (one-time chosen message) attack protocol* on signature scheme $$\Sigma = (\gen, \sgn, \vrf)$$ is given by

Clearly it is the restriction of $$\ECM^-$$ when $$l := 1$$, thus $$\ECM_1^- \leq \ECM^-$$.

We will give three different constructions of $$\ECM_1^-$$ secure schemes, based on different complexity assumptions.
