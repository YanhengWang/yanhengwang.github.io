By now we have seen general techniques in constructing $$\ECM^+$$ secure signature schemes. The roadmap is summarised below. Arrow represent direct implications.

Although theoretically satisfactory, this is not the end of the story. In the remaining chapters we will study more concrete $$\ECM^+$$ secure schemes that aim at improving performance or providing new features. In particular we investigate:

- schemes that directly root in the RSA assumption and bypass the chain of transformations we have developed. Consequently, they run much faster and produce much shorter signatures.
- schemes based on *chameleon hashing* that allows some extent of deniability.
- schemes based on *pairing* that enables aggregating multiple signatures into a bulk.

Our exposition will shift to a less formal (but still rigorous) language and focus on the gist.
