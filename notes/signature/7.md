By now we have seen general techniques in constructing $$\ECM^+$$ secure signature schemes. The roadmap is summarised below. Arrow represent direct implications.

![](./7-summary.svg){:.centering}

Although theoretically satisfactory, this is not the end of the story. In the remaining chapters we will study more concrete $$\ECM^+$$ secure schemes that aim at improving performance and/or providing new features. In particular we investigate two genres:

- Schemes that directly root in the RSA assumption and bypass the chain of transformations we have developed. They run much faster and also significantly reduce signature lengths.
- Schemes based on the so-called "Diffie-Hellman assumption" and an algebraic structure named "pairings". These schemes are rather efficient, and enable aggregating/verifying multiple signatures in a large batch.

Our exposition will shift to a less formal (but still rigorous) language and focus on the gist.
