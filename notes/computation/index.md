> I wrote these notes (in Chinese) when I took a bachelor course *Theory of Computation* by Prof. Huan Long. They follow Sipser's amazing textbook *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* that sparked my interest in theoretical computer science. The point becomes apparent through my somewhat enthusiastic style in the notes; my apologies if I overdid it occasionally.
