title: Course Notes on Theory of Computation
---

> I was writing these notes (in Chinese) when I took my bachelor course *Theory of Computation* in 2019. They follow Sipser's amazing textbook *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* that sparked my interest in theoretical computer science. The point becomes apparent through my somewhat enthusiastic style in the notes; my apologies if I overdid it occasionally.
