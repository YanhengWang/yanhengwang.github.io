title: "Fine-Grained Reductions"
about: "A collection of fine-grained reductions from central problems: satisfiability, orthogonal vectors, 3-sum, and all-pair shortest paths."
---

In fine-grained complexity theory, polynomial-time solvable problems are related by reductions that preserve the exponent of running time. This allows us to classify problems within P and to identify the central source of hardness.
