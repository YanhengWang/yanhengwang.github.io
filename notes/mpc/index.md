title: Secure Multiparty Computation
about: A mix of benevolent and malicious parties are engaged in a computational task, where each party provides an input. Is there a protocol that protects the input privacy of benevolent parties? We develop various solutions and compare their security guarantees, communication complexity, and applicability.
