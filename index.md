about: |-
  <p>I'm a PhD student at Saarland University, affiliated to Max Planck Institute for Informatics. My advisor is Karl Bringmann.</p>
  <p>I'm intersted in randomised and combinatorial algorithms. Currently my work revolves around the problem of union volume estimation, which asks for the approximate volume/cardinality of the union of \(n\) given sets. Sometimes we also impose geometric structure on the sets and/or restrict the computational model. The overarching goal is to design really efficient algorithms and, on the flip side, to show lower bounds.
  <p>Before my PhD studies, I finished my master at ETH Zürich and my bachelor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was fortunate in having many great advisors over time: Nicolas El Maalouly, Bernd Gärtner, Dominik Scheder and Chihao Zhang.</p>
