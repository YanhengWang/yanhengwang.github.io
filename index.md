  <p>Welcome to my site, and feel free to look around!</p>
  <p>I'm doing my Master degree in computer science at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I finished my bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Dominik Scheder and Prof. Chihao Zhang.</p>
  <p>My interest lies in theoretical computer science, in particular discrete probability and combinatorial algorithms. I have been doing research in these areas: Markov chain Monte Carlo, Boolean satisfiability, and the exact matching problem.</p>
