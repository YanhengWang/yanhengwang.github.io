  <p>Welcome! I'm a master student in computer science at ETH ZÃ¼rich, after finishing my bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>
  <p>I have an interest in theoretical computer science, in particular exploiting randomness algorithmically. My undergraduate project and thesis themes were Markov chain Monte Carlo and Boolean satisfiability. I learnt a lot from Prof. Chihao Zhang and Prof. Dominik Scheder from their great guidance, to whom I am always grateful.</p>
