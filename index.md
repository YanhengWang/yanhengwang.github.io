about: |-
  <p>Welcome! I'm current doing my master studies in computer science at ETH ZÃ¼rich, after I finished my bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>
  <p>I have an interest in theoretical computer science, in particular exploiting randomness algorithmically. My undergraduate project and thesis themes were Markov chain Monte Carlo and Boolean satisfiability. I learnt a lot from my advisors Prof. Chihao Zhang and Prof. Dominik Scheder, to whom I am always grateful.</p>
