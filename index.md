about: |-
  <p>Welcome! I'm a master's student in computer science at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I finished my bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Dominik Scheder and Prof. Chihao Zhang.</p>
  <p>My interest lies in theoretical computer science, in particular the application of (discrete) probability in algorithms. I'm also exploring other branches with a focus on their combinatorial side. My undergraduate project and thesis themes were Markov chain Monte Carlo and Boolean satisfiability.</p>
