about: |-
  <p>Welcome! I'm a master student in computer science at ETH Zürich, after finishing my bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p>
  <p>I have an interest in theoretical computer science, in particular exploiting randomness algorithmically. My undergraduate project and thesis themes were Markov chain Monte Carlo and Boolean satisfiability. I learnt a lot from the great guidance by Prof. Chihao Zhang and Prof. Dominik Scheder, to whom I am always grateful.</p>
